                        <h2>1. Introduction.</h2>

                        <p class="nft_static14">Welcome to the Powned website, owned and operated by Powned (“Powned,” “we,” “us” or “our”). These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Powned website; including without limitation the creation, purchase, sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

                        <p>This Service also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via auction (“Auction”). You may only participate in the Auction by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions such as MetaMask (<a href="https://metamask.io/">https://metamask.io/</a>). MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. Before putting up your unique digital asset for Auction or putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset from another user, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to sell or purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf.</p>
                        
                        <p>“Crypto Assets” refers to unique non-fungible tokens, implemented on the Ethereum blockchain (the “Ethereum Platform”) using smart contracts.</p>

                        <p>ALL TRANSACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH OUR SERVICE ARE FACILITATED AND RUN BY THIRD-PARTY ELECTRONIC WALLET EXTENSIONS, AND BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. FOR METAMASK, THOSE TERMS ARE AVAILABLE AT (<a href="https://metamask.io/terms.html">https://metamask.io/terms.html</a>) AND (<a href="https://metamask.io/privacy.html">https://metamask.io/privacy.html</a>)</p>

                        <p>POWNED IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OR CREDITOR. THE SERVICES ARE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY. POWNED FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER IN THE AUCTION BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER OF CRYPTO ASSETS OR BETWEEN ANY USERS.</p>

                        <p>YOU BEAR FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS YOU PURCHASE ON POWNED. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST VERIFICATION, POWNED MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS ON THE PLATFORM.</p>

                        <p>Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to describe additional terms for specific services. Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant services, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.</p>

                        <p>THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, SO PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE AGREEING TO MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE READ SECTION 15 CAREFULLY.</p>

                        <p>BY CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, COMPLETING THE ACCOUNT REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING OUR SERVICES AND/OR PURCHASING CRYPTO ASSETS, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Service or purchase the Crypto Assets.</p>

                        <p>Powned reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification, providing notice through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the Terms frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the Service.</p>

                        <p>Powned facilitates trade among a diverse community of buyers and sellers. Openness is one of our most prized values, and we're committed to providing a platform for the exchange of a wide range of content, including controversial content. These policies ensure that our marketplace offers the widest selection of assets possible while promoting trust and respect, as well as adherence to the law.
                        </p>
                        <p>Powned has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when we discover them or they're brought to our attention.
                        </p>
                        <p>Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that Powned deems inappropriate, disruptive, or illegal are prohibited on Powned. Powned reserves the rights to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site and remove any listing at any time. If you create or offer an asset, listing, smart contract, or collection in violation of these policies, we will take corrective actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to removing the asset, listing, smart contract, or collection, deleting your Powned account, and permanently withholding referral payments and developer revenue sharing fees. Powned cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve the right to destroy inappropriate metadata stored on our servers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that include metadata that violates international or United States intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self-harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal in the United States are prohibited on Powned and will be removed.
                        </p>

                        <p>Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections with a primary or substantial purpose in a game or application that violates international or United States intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self-harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal in the United States are prohibited on Powned and will be removed.</p>

                        <p>Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections created or used primarily or substantially for the purpose of raising funds for the known terrorist organizations are prohibited on Powned and will be removed.</p>

                        <p>The sale of stolen assets, converted assets, fraudulently obtained assets, assets taken without authorization, and other illegally obtained assets on Powned is prohibited. Listing illegally obtained assets may result in your listings being cancelled, your assets being hidden, or your account being suspended.</p>

                        <p>If you have reason to believe that an asset listed on Powned was illegally obtained, please contact us immediately at support@Powned.co. Include the asset's ID, the asset's contract address, and evidence demonstrating that the asset was illegally obtained. Powned will review your claim and reply within 72 hours. If we determine from the evidence that the asset is stolen, we will hide it or disable trading of it.</p>

                        <p>We require all users to be 18 years old or older. If you are under 18, you may use a parent or guardian's Powned account, but only with involvement of the account holder. However, the account holder is responsible for everything done with that account.</p>

                        <p>NSFW content is meant for people who are 18 years and older. We allow the sale of this content, but it is subject to being marked NSFW and handled differently than non-NSFW content in navigation menus and search results. Asset names, listings and their descriptions, smart contract names, and collections including profanity or overtly sexual content are prohibited on Powned and will be removed. A smart contract that contains NSFW content is subject to being marked NSFW, even if the NSFW content only represent a portion of the content on the smart contract.</p>

                        <p>Do not create or list illegal or offensive content, such as products that depict graphic sexual acts and images that depict children under the age of 18 in a sexually suggestive manner. Do not use profanity or graphic language in any content you list or create on Powned.</p>

                        <p>Bottom line about NSFW content: it's permitted on Powned, but we're going to do our best to keep it out of the high traffic areas and if it's extreme in any way, we'll probably remove it.</p>

                        <p>If you become aware of the creation, listing, or buying of assets in violation of any of the terms specified in this section, you shall contact us to report it. Creators bear special responsibility for informing Powned of the existence of their collections, contracts, and assets that violate these terms.
